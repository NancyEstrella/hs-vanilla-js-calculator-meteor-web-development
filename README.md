# JavaScript Calculator

It's time to build a calculator. You all have some idea of how a calculator works: you enter two numbers and an operator and then the calculator gives you the solution.

## Let's Get Started

You'll be coding your solution in `js/calc.js`. You also need to fill out `index.html`. We've left it blank this time, so you'll need to fill out the basic HTML structure and link your JavaScript file. Remember to have `index.html` open in the browser so that you can see the changes you made to `js/calc.js`.

Think about how you take in user input with Javascript. What function did we use for that? You'll want to store the input from your user in variables so you know what numbers and operator they want to work with.

From there, you'll want your app to trigger different actions based on the information the user entered. **If** they entered a `+` then you want the calculator to do addition, subtraction for `-`, etc. 

How all of this comes together is up to you!


### Bonus

It would be pretty cool if you could make this like a normal calculator on the computer where you just typed numbers and the operator into a form and pressed submit. You'd have to use jQuery for for submission, and some HTML to create the form. It might take some seriously Googling, but see if you can give it a try!
